# Meridian Strategic Methodology (MSM)

## Overview
The Meridian Strategic Methodology (MSM) is our proprietary approach to consulting engagements, refined through hundreds of successful projects across diverse industries. MSM ensures consistent, high-quality delivery while maintaining flexibility to adapt to unique client needs.

## Core Principles

### 1. Fact-Based Decision Making

### 2. Collaborative Partnership
We work as an extension of the client team, fostering knowledge transfer and building internal capabilities.

### 3. Implementation Focus
Every strategy must be actionable, with clear implementation plans and success metrics.

### 4. Continuous Learning
We continuously refine our approach based on lessons learned and industry best practices.
