## Pricing Models

### 1. Time and Materials (T&M)

**Payment**: Monthly billing cycles
**Risk**: Low for Meridian, High for client

**Advantages:**

*"This T&M approach provides maximum flexibility as we discover and address your unique challenges. You pay only for time invested, with full transparency into our activities and progress."*

### 2. Fixed Price Project
**When to Use**: Well-defined scope, clear deliverables, standard methodologies
**Structure**: Total project fee based on estimated effort + risk premium
**Payment**: Milestone-based payments
**Risk**: Medium for both parties

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Fixed Price = (Estimated Hours × Blended Rate) × Risk Multiplier × Profit Margin

```

Typical Value Capture Rate: 8-15% of first-year benefits
Minimum Fee: 120% of cost-based pricing
Maximum Fee: 25% of projected 3-year benefits
```

**Client Communication:**
*"Value-based pricing aligns our success with yours. We're compensated based on the measurable value we create, ensuring maximum focus on outcomes that matter to your business."*
