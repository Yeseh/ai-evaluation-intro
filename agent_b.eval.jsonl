These roles typically command a 15\u201330% markup, reflecting the value their expertise brings to client projects.\n\n2. Value-Based Pricing Model:\n- For high-impact strategic projects, Meridian uses value-based pricing tied to the measurable benefits delivered to clients. Fees are often 20\u201340% higher than traditional time-and-materials models, aligning Meridian\u2019s compensation with the client\u2019s value creation and ensuring a focus on outcomes.\n\n3. Boutique Service and Proven Methodology:\n- Meridian emphasizes hands-on, personalized service and proprietary methodologies that drive results.

Success and Results Orientation:\n- Many project fees, particularly in M&A and strategy engagements, include success-based components directly tied to deal completion and measurable synergy capture\u2014demonstrating Meridian\u2019s confidence in its ability to deliver transformative results.\n\n6. Competitive Positioning:\n- Compared to Big Four and global strategy houses, Meridian\u2019s rates are higher for bespoke service and expertise, but are justified by implementation focus, results orientation, and unmatched business integration.\n\nThese factors collectively support Meridian\u2019s premium pricing by ensuring clients receive top-tier talent, proven methodologies, and measurable business outcomes.\n\nIf you need exact rate details or a direct comparison to specific competitors, I can provide that as well."}
